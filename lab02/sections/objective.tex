\section{Objective}\label{sec:objective}
This experiment will create a type of RC circuit called a \emph{phase lag circuit}.
The circuit's transfer function will be used to determine the component values in the circuit for pre-defined frequency responses.
The magnitude and phase responses of the circuit will be examined for a range of input frequencies.
