\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Our results confirm a sinusoid is negatively shifted by a capacitor, as well as the low-pass filter nature of the voltage across a capacitor: when the frequency of the sinusoid across the capacitor the capacitor is low it acts similar to an open circuit, and when the frequency is high the capacitor acts like a short circuit.
The negative phase shift behaviour of a capacitor justifies the circuit's \textit{phase lag} denomination.
