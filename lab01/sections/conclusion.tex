\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Building and analyzing the two op-amp based dependent sources showed the assumptions made regarding op-amps are largely valid. Assuming rail-to-rail output voltage swing showed while the meausured voltage swing was lower, it was only lower by 16\% on the lower bound, and 10\% lower on the upper bound, in the case of the VCVS source. While the internl resistance of the sources, especially the current source, are not zero, in comparison to the resistances on the input and the load resistance for typical use of an op-amp (which is not a high-power circuit), this assumption is valid. The assumption of 0\si{\volt} potential between the input pins was shown to be valid, with a measured potential of 0.97\si{\milli\volt}: significantly lower than the voltages elsewhere in the circuit, and within the error caused by input biases.
