\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Two dependent sources were created and analyzed in this lab. A voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS) and a voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) were the examples of both voltages sources and current sources in this lab. A schematic of both circuits built is available in the lab manual. \cite[p.~18]{lab-manual}
