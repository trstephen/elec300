% vcvs
What is expected response? Refer to formulas in lab manual.

Response is capped at expected values on positive side but is lower than expected on negative side. Why?

Effect of load changing Rl = 1k to 150?

% vccs
Expected response?

Same asymmetric capping as vcvs. Why?

Effect of changing Rl = 1k to 0?

Diff between  V+ and V-? Same as expected (0)?
