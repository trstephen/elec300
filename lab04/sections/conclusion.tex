\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Active first-order circuits were examined.
The behavior predicted using s-domain analysis was reflected in the response of each type of circuit.
The operation of an inverter, adder, integrator and summing integrator were theoretically determined, then confirmed through experiment.
This experiment provided intuitive reinforcement of first-order concepts learned in class.
