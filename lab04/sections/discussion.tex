\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
We confirmed frequency analysis through the Laplace transform is a valid and efficient way to analyze the response of a circuit to inputs of particular or varying frequencies. 

The output of the inverter circuit in Fig.~\ref{fig:inverter} is of equal amplitude to the input waveform, but has a gain of approximately -1. This is the expected behaviour of an inverter circuit.

The adder circuit has an output, visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:inverter} of the same phase as the input signal, however the output signal is the result of adding the input signal to itself, having a gain of 2. This deviates from the experimental procedure of add a DC offset to the input sinusoid, however adding the input to itself confirms the adder circuit functions correctly when both inputs are time varying, or AC signals.

The output of the integrator circuit in Fig.~\ref{fig:integrator} is the result of removing a short across the feedback capacitor, which acts as the integrating element. This ensures the integrator has an initial value of 0, and climbs to the op-amps saturation voltage of 15\si{\volt} when a DC input of approximately -0.1\si{\volt} is provided.

The final circuit, which is a first order system, demonstrates the expected response of such a system to a unit-step input: that is, the system approaches the input signal according to a time-decaying inverse exponential, which is visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:first-order}.
