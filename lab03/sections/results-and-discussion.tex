\section{Results and Discussion}\label{sec:results-and-discussion}
Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic} was realized with damping factor $\zeta = 0.1$.
Using \eqref{eqn:damping}, $R_a = \SI{70.2}{\kilo\ohm}$.
The opamp supply power was set at \SI{+-15}{\volt}.
An input signal of 1 $\si{\volt}_{pp}$ at \SI{50}{\hertz} square wave was applied to the circuit.
One pulse of the square wave will behave locally like a unit step function.

The output of this circuit is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:overshoot}.
The large overshoot corresponds to significant underdamping, which is consistent with $\zeta = 0.1$.

The measured values are $O_v = \SI{2.225}{\volt}$ and $T_p = \SI{460}{\micro\second}$.
As the transient response is damped, the value of the output settles to \SI{2.8}{\volt}.
This is consistent with $G = 1.8$.
