\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We realized a second-order voltage amplifier, and found the response of the system using a unit-step input. Our results were consistent with our calculated values of $\zeta$ and $\omega$, with zeta being slightly lower due to non-idealistic parameters such as resistive losses in the capacitors and the wide tolerances present in capacitors values. Overall, our results resembled the general response of a second order system.
